# git-exercise

A branch, a commit, a merge's soft grace,
Git weaves its magic, in time and in space.
From staging's small steps to history's deep hold,
A versioning story, forever untold.
With push and with pull, the code finds its way,
Through conflicts and changes, it brightens the day.

Through conflicts and changes, it brightens the day.

A tangled web of branches, a merge's harsh sting,
Git's cryptic commands, where frustrations take wing.
"Detached HEAD" whispers, a desolate sound,
Lost commits and conflicts, where sanity's drowned.

The index, a puzzle, a staging's dark art,
A push that rejects, tearing workflows apart.
"Rebase" and "reset," like spells in the night,
Leaving developers trembling, devoid of all light.

A version control beast, with a powerful claw,
Git's might can both build, and utterly maul.
Though mastery beckons, a distant, faint gleam,
The journey through Git, is a developer's bad dream.
